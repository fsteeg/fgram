Conclusion</A>
</H1>

We described a modular implementation of a language generation system, representing underlying structures and lexical entries using domain-specific languages. The system makes use of an input format based on <A
 HREF="node7.html#Dik1997a">Dik (1997)</A> and consists of modules implemented in Java, Prolog and ANTLR, making it easy to extend for FDG representations. As all structures used in FDG as well as the lexical entries as Prolog facts have a common tree structure, a unified implementation using ANTLR to define and process all these structures is feasible and would allow further processing in all the target languages supported by ANTLR (currently Java, C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Python and Ruby). The system can be used to evaluate and improve FDG with respect to theoretical and representational issues; by means of its modular architecture it could act as the language generation component in a larger NLP system or as a tool for formal notation in linguistic description. The implementation and infrastructure for collaborative development is available at http://fgram.sourceforge.net.
