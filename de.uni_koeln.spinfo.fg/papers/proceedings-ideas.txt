- Take the original poster abstract as the basis
- Update it from the poster, add content from there
- Add an ANTLR grammar for the representational level
- Some exemplary impl: e.g. input format checking for rl
- Add technical info, e.g. the properties file (to shows the whole concept 
of flexibilty of chosen symbols, in the grammar, in the prolog code, the 
prop file being the mapping, all customizable etc.)
