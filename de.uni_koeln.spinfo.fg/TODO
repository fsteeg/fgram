TODO

- important: check out some more complex structure that should work with the prolog ex. rules... 
  (dreistellige verben, nebensaetze, adjektive, zweimal man -> them...)
- add pragmatic functions to ucs and processing
- more useful messages from things going wrong on the prolog side, more info on lexicon, available words etc...
- check out the best way to change states or streams or whatever in antlr, to get all roles and correct upper/lower
