<p><b>A modular language generator based on the theory of
Functional Grammar by Simon C. Dik (FG), implemented using Java for the
user interface and input processing, ANTLR for the input format parser
and Prolog for the grammar and lexicon module, treating underlying
linguistic structure and lexical entries as domain-specific languages.</b></p>

<p><img class="image1" src="fgram.png" alt="System Overview (see Paper and Poster)" /></p>

<p>The program uses a Swing-based Java GUI or a JSP-based web
interface to enter an abstract representation of the expression to
generate, called an <i>underlying clause structure</i> (UCS). The format
of that UCS is defined as an ANTLR grammar, from which a parser for the
input format is generated.</p>

<p>The input UCS is parsed by that parser and transformed into an
internal Java object representation. Using the object representation of
the parsed UCS, a Prolog representation of the desired structure is
written to a file, which is then used by the Prolog grammar module to
generate the actual linguistic expression, which is finally displayed in
the GUI (see figure).</p>

<p>The reason for using Java for the user interface and processing
of the UCS on the one hand and Prolog for the expression rules and the
lexicon on the other hand stems from the idea of using implementation
languages well suited for a particular task. Java is a widespread
multi-purpose programming language with abundant supply of libraries,
while Prolog offers convenient notation and processing mechanisms, is
familiar to many linguists and has a particular strong standing as an
implementation language for FG.</p>

<p>By using an input format based on the representation used in the
theory of FG the system can be used to evaluate and improve the theory
of Functional Grammar with respect to theoretical and representational
issues in language generation. By means of the modular architecture
consisting of exchangable modules for entering a UCS, transforming the
UCS and using the transformed representation to generate the linguistic
expression this program could act as a language generation or input
processing module in other FG-based NLP systems.</p>

<p>Through the modular architecture and in particular the usage of a
parser generator like ANTLR, the system can be extended for different
input formats. Experimental ANTLR v3 grammar files for <i>Functional
Discourse Grammar</i> (FDG) representations on the <i>Representational
Level</i> and the <i>Interpersonal Level</i> can be found in the project
repository.</p>

<p>The lexicon and grammar component originates from a dialog-based
Prolog-only implementation developed since 1989 by Paul O. Samuelsdorff,
later with Christoph Benden, at the Department of Linguistics,
University of Cologne, of which the latest version is included.</p>
